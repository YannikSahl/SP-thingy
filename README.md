<p align="center">
  An application that provides a better user experience when working with database files located on a SharePoint.
</p>

# Overview

This application was designed and developed as part of a university course during the summer semester of 2020.  

The idea for the application was to enhance the user experience of the team at Deutsche Bahn. Instead of working with different Access Database files stored on a Microsoft SharePoint instance and the team having to manually navigate and download / upload the files, __SharePoint-Wrapper__ takes care of that.  
The app also presents a frontend to the Database files, resulting in a more convenient user experience.
